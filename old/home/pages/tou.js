						<span className='font-bold'>5. Child users</span>
						<br />A child user is under the age of 18 years who is not legally
						competent, without the assistance of a competent person, to take any
						action or decision in respect of any matter concerning him- or
						herself. A competent person is any person who is legally competent
						to consent to any action or decision being taken in respect of any
						matter concerning a child. The child's parent or legal guardian
						would qualify as a competent person. In order for the child to
						complete the registration process, he or she will need to get the
						consent of a competent person. Consent by a competent person will
						usually be given before or at the time of agreement, but it may also
						be given afterwards by the parent's guardian's subsequent
						ratification of the agreement. The agreement is then validated
						retroactively. The child user's consent can be withdrawn after the
						child user reaches the age of 18 years and above. The withdrawn
						consent has to be in writing and directed to Just Brands Africa
						(PTY) Ltd, Reg. 2013/228381/07, at{' '}
						<a href='mailto:privacy@suadvantage.co.za'>
							privacy@suadvantage.co.za
						</a>{' '}
						to action within reasonable time. The withdrawn consent can be
						wholly or in part in which case it needs to be specific to the
						particular action connected to the consent being withdrawn. The
						child user loses the right to cancel the agreement where the child
						or any person acting on his or her behalf, by act or omission, led
						the Company to believe that he or she had an unfettered legal
						capacity to agreement, or attempted to obscure or suppress the fact
						that the capacity was absent.
